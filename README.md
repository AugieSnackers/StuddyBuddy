Studdy buddy is an app that lets you know what your friends/colleagues are studying.  Users log on with google emails 
  and are brought to the main screen where they can see what people have posted recently, and also a text box appears 
  where they can post what they are studying using # followed by their class number.  Users have the option to filter 
  what appears on their news feed to search for a specific class.
